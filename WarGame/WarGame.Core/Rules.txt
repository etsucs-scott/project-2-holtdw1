-------------------Task 1 — Model Cards and Decks--------------------------------------

     Create a Card class with Suit and Rank (2 through Ace). 
    Cards must be comparable by rank (Ace high).
    Create a Deck class that holds a Stack<Card>. 
    Initialize the deck with a standard 52-card set (4 suits × 13 ranks) and shuffle it.

---------------------Task 2 — Implement the War Engine----------------------------------------

Use these required classes and structures:

    Hand holds a Queue<Card> for each player.
    PlayerHands holds a Dictionary<string, Hand> keyed by player name.
    PlayedCards holds a Dictionary<string, Card> of each round’s face-up cards.
    Distribute the Deck evenly to all players at start.

Rules (modified for this project):

    Rank order (low to high): 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A. Suits are ignored.
    Each round: all players with cards reveal the top card from their hand.
    Highest rank wins the round and collects all played cards.
    On a tie for highest rank, only the tied players play a tiebreaker round.
    Cards from tied rounds stay in a shared pot; the eventual winner takes the entire pot.
    Each tiebreaker round is one additional face-up card (no face-down cards).
    If a player has 0 cards at the start of a round, they are eliminated.
    If a tied player cannot play a tiebreaker card, they are eliminated immediately.
    Play continues until one player holds all cards or a round limit is reached.

Pot Management (Required)

    Use a List<Card> as the pot.
    All cards revealed in a round go into the pot immediately.
    If only some players tie, the non-tied players’ cards still go into the pot.
    Winner takes the entire pot and adds cards to the back of their queue in the order played.

Dealing (Required)

    Deal one card at a time in round-robin order.
    If cards don’t divide evenly (e.g., 52 cards / 3 players), the first players in order get the extra cards.

Round Limit (Required)

    Set a hard cap of 10,000 rounds.
    If the cap is reached, the winner is the player with the most cards.
    If still tied, declare a draw.

------------------------Task 3 — Console Runner + Reporting------------------------------------

The console app should do the following:

    Support 2, 3, or 4 players (prompt or command-line argument).
    Use default names: Player 1, Player 2, etc.
    Print each round’s winner and current card counts.
    Report ties and tiebreaker results clearly.
    End cleanly when a player wins and report the winner.

------------------------------Task 4 — UML Diagram-----------------------------

    Create a UML class diagram for the required classes.
    Show relationships (inheritance/aggregation/composition) where appropriate.
    Submit your .asta file or a PDF/PNG export.

-----------------------------Task 5 — README.md------------------------------

    Explain how to build and run the game.
    Document how player count is chosen (prompt or arguments).
    Include a short submission note referencing your GitHub Classroom repo.

Add code comments for each class, each function, and any non-obvious or tricky code blocks.
